What exactly is SQL?

SQL stands for "Structured Query Language". SQL is a domain-specific language, which differs from other gerneral-purpose programming languages such as Python or Java. The purpose of SQL is to manage data in a relational database and it can be more defined as a 'requesting language'.

NOTE: A relational database (RDBMS) is a common choice for storage because they are easier to understand and use. RDBMS presents information in table form, such as an excel sheet and allow the user to manipulate the data using relational operators.

HISTORY: SQL was the first commercial language to use the 'relational model' for databases in the 1970s. SQL is the standard for ANSI and ISO since the mid 1980s.

SQL is made up of three components; data definition language, data manipulation language, and data control language. Through these three, you can do the following:
<ul>
  <li> SQL can execute queries against a database</li>
  <li>SQL can retrieve data from a database</li>
  <li>SQL can insert records in a database</li>
  <li>SQL can update records in a database</li>
  <li>SQL can delete records from a database</li>
  <li>SQL can create new databases</li>
  <li>SQL can create new tables in a database</li>
  <li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database</li>
  <li>SQL can create views in a database</li>
  <li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
</ul>

You can think of SQL as the way to use an excel sheet but through the terminal/command line. In this metaphor, the database is the excell sheet, complete with tables, columns, and rows to sort and categorize data.
