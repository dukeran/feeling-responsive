teaser: "After practicing a few interview questions for some of the internships I would like to apply to for the Summer, I realized that I needed to fill a huge gap in my knowledge base - algorithms and data structures. I did research on whether or not to take the class through a local community college or to take a Princeton Coursera Course. The difference in price led to choose the latter. The course, however, uses Java as an expository language which means that it is now time to take a few crash courses in Java!"
