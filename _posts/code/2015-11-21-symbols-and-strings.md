title:  The Difference between Strings and Symbols
teaser: "I've decided to create a Ruby on Rails platform in order to automate soem business I have during the school year.  Instead of hiring managers and editors, it is much easier for me (and good practice) to instead create a Rails app that will make the process much easier and much less painless - not to mention cost effective. With a push of a button, I can have users submit necessary forms, contact information, subscribe to a newslist, have the submissions appear on the admin panel and delegate submissions to certain individuals to create the prodcut based on the submission's attributes.

The more I work the more I learn new things as an intern developer. Being self-taught however, comes with many drawbacks - I don't have the broad fundamentals that others have. My goal, therefore, is to get as deep of an understanding of the fundamentals as possible, no matter how simple the concepts are. Today, I am going to write bout something that I had never actually thought about even though I use it everyday.

###Symbols

Symbols are used so often, that if you don't know what they are or how they are used, it could negatively impact your understanding of your code. Symbols appear with a colon in front;

` :name, :email, :phone_number `

Symbols are often used as keys - an object that you will manipulate and call upon often throughout the app. They are important because they are easir for Ruby to access.

##Strings

Strings are used to store a particular value. It's much harder to manipulate a string the same way you manipulate a key. It's wordier and is harder to conceptualize then symbols which are easier to treat as symbols. Strings are written out in either single or double quotation marks.

`"Hello World!"`

You can instantly tell that this is a string instead of a symbol (other than the quotations of coures) because of the capitalization, exclamation mark, and the space.

When it comes to keys, keep it simple, keep it clean, and keep it short. A key is a single word, the second you need punctuation of any sort or the symbol becomes lengthy, it's time to use a stirng.
