subheadline: "Teach Yourself C"
title: "Does Programming Hold the Key to Understanding Human Language?"
teaser: "After just finishing the first chapter of Schildt's book, I can't help but be struck how similar the first (and potentially more) chapter of this book was to a grammar book for a foreign language. For example, there is a segment in the first chapter which states, "a prototype consists of a function's name, its return type, and its parameter list...the compiler needs to know this information in order for it to properly execute a call to the function." This is the equivalent of a grammar book explaining how a sentence is structured in the foreign language; a sentence contains an object, verb, and subject. Just switch out the word 'compiler' with 'brain' and it strikes me as a very human-like system."

The difference I see is that with "Teach Yourself C", the grammar - or syntax - is laid out very logically and mathematically, while in foreign grammar books, a lot is taught by example and by practice, hoping that your brain compiler will pick up on the patterns and the logic.

After taking two years of semantics and pragmatics, I can't help but see a correlation between programming and the field of semantics. I believe that this is mostly due to the fact that first order logic and second order logic is in play with programming as it is in semantics and so the fundamentals are the same/come from the same train of thought. This comparison is even more stark for me since I started with Ruby, a language developed about twenty years after C. Ruby is a high level language, many things are implied in the writing and so one does not need to explicitly know how the code is processed by the compiler for it to work like magic. C, on the other hand, appears to me like a primitive ape, having to define the value and types of every single parameter/argument seems like a crazy waste of time to me.

In semantics, our class of four students (semantics was not the most popular and fun subject in linguistics) would often puzzle over logically map out a sentence such as "Mars is a red planet" with both 'red' and 'planet' being a function that required a unique argument. We struggled and failed to map it out because there was only one unique argument until our teacher showed us the 'logical form' of the same sentence; "Mars is red and Mars is a planet". Now we had two unique arguments for the two functions and the sentence could easily be mapped out. She explained how language simplifies itself over time, reducing logically superfluous phrases because language is forever on a path of simplicity.

Ruby, to me, is a language that is couched in simplicity for us 'speakers'. C represents an older form of code language, one which shows us the more archaic 'logical form' that underlies all programming. I wonder (and will some day find out) if even older programming languages show more archaic logical forms. Or is it that being a creation of humanity, the first programming languages are only a reflection of the extent of our logical/semantic knowledge of language? I would love to find out if there is a paper or any academia thought on this, because the implications are incredibly interesting. Linguists are always searching for a set of universal human grammar rules that all humans use while constructing language. It is believed that through this universal grammar we can uncover how the brain works and thinks. Also, historical linguists are trying to discover how language evolves over time which is difficult when the last speakers of the language in question died thousands of years ago with no written record. In my opinion, programming languages also reflect the evolution of human languages. From just a little bit of research, it appears to me that programming languages also have language trees and all current programming languages were influenced by one previous and so on until you arrive to the original programming language. Once again, one could argue that programming languages are human creations, but isn't natural language also a fundamental human creation?
