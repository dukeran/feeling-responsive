Programming, to me, is not only a vehicle to success, <br>
But also a fascination, an exploration of the capabilities of the human mind, <br>
With the creation of AI, we can begin to understand humankind, <br>
Because by creating technology, we are in reality, creating a reflection of ourselves, <br>
With each Boolean one and zero, we mimic the firing of the neurons within our brains, <br>
And with each day Siri and others like her increase their gain, <br>
Until one day, the gap between machine and human closes, <br>
As the capacity of language that has separate humans from other creatures, <br>
No longer separates us from what we have created; <br>
Who am I? <br>
Machine or Human? <br>
Someday we may not know the difference. <br>
