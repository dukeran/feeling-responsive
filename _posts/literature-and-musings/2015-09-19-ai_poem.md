Programming, to me, is not only a vehicle to success,
But also a fascination, an exploration of the capabilities of the human mind,
With the creation of AI, we can begin to understand humankind,
Because by creating technology, we are in reality, creating a reflection of ourselves,
With each Boolean one and zero, we mimic the firing of the neurons within our brains,
And with each day Siri and others like her increase their gain,
Until one day, the gap between machine and human closes,
As the capacity of language that has separate humans from other creatures,
No longer separates us from what we have created;
Who am I?
