<em>The bulky grey heart monitor recorded the irregular heart beat of a young girl lying on a hospital bed. The monitor flickered, creating an eerie glow around the girl that flashed in and out with each beat. She was motionless, her brown hair bunched in matted dreads from dirt and sweat, framing her gaunt face. Her eyes were open though, big and almost sinister, they were fixed onto the only other person in the room...
</em> <!--more-->...a skinny, frail man dressed in a white lab coat. He had entered the small room just moments before. The man swallowed nervously and approached the bed, careful to position himself at an arms-length distance away...



The girl didn’t move, but her eyes followed his every movement.
He leaned forward an inch, “What’s your name, sweetie?” His voice came out higher than he was expecting. He cleared his throat.
The only answer was the heart monitor.
“How old are you?” He tried again, the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end.
Her grey eyes flickered and she blinked but made no other movement.
“Where were you before you came here?” By now his heart was pounding against his rib cage. His hands felt clammy.


There was movement from the door and he jumped, nervous. The door opened and a tall woman entered the room, her short black hair slicked back and a pair of round-rimmed glasses perched on her hawk-like nose. She walked towards the man with long, confident strides while her lips were a thin line of frustration. The man turned to her, unable to hide his feelings of relief at having someone else at his side.
“Baptiste, sir,” said the man and with new found confidence, “Is she stupid or just plain mute?”

The woman stood beside him, seeming to ponder the question as she stared at the young girl. The silence in the room was almost unbearable, and the heart monitor only made it worse.

“Leave,” said Baptiste, her voice carrying the authority of a leader, never taking her eyes off the girl.
The man didn’t need to be told twice and he exited the room in silence.

When the man left the room, the girl’s owlish eyes shifted towards the woman who was now at her bedside. Baptiste didn’t say a word. If this was going to be a waiting game, then she would wait with all the patience in the world. After than an hour of silence, at last, a small but steady voice was heard, “I have a message for Andrea Parks”.
Baptiste completely pale but retained her composure, “A message for whom?”

“Andrea Parks,” came a measured reply. Her grey eyes didn’t reveal any emotion.

“What is the message?”

“I don’t know, but I have to deliver it to Andrea Parks.”
Baptiste glanced up at the wall for a few seconds and then brought her gaze back down to look upon the young girl, “Andrea Parks was executed for treason five years ago”.

A look of surprise flashed through the girl’s eyes before she quickly closed them. With a faint whisper she said, “but Andrea Parks is my mother”.

Baptiste turned on her heels and fled from the sparse hospital room into the grimy hallway. A fluorescent light flickered and the door slammed behind her.
Just outside the room, two scientists waited.

Baptiste barked orders, “I want a full physical done on this girl. I want to know exactly how old she is, where she comes from, and how the fuck she knows Andrea Parks."

“Yes, Ms. Baptiste, sir” The two said in unison and swiftly went down the hallway.

Baptiste furrowed her brow and leaned against the wall that separated her from the girl on the other side. All she could hear was the incessant beeping and her thoughts wandered back to the painful memories of her past. “Oh, Andrea...” she whispered to herself as closed her eyes and drew a deep breath before she continued walking down the hall towards her small office. She opened the door and began to take out  classified papers and travel logs, shuffling through them, searching for a clue.

There was a knock on the door.

“Come in,” Baptiste put down her travel logs that she had just been furiously looking through and looked down her glasses to assess the visitor. Baptiste sat in an armchair, a small lamp casting a warm glow on a wooden desk. There was a framed picture of a forest that hung on the other wall. The scientist sat on the other side of the desk in a chair that constituted the only other piece of furniture in the room.

Doctor Sanders didn’t say anything as he slid five polaroid photos across the table. Baptiste picked up the photos and looked at each one intently before saying, “Show me.”

Doctor Sanders led the way as the two walked down the hallway just a few doors down. He opened the door and Baptiste noted that two more monitors were hooked up to the girl, the cords disappearing under the blanket that she had pulled up to her chin. Doctor Sanders approached the bed. Without saying anything, ripped back the sheet from the girl’s body, revealing her naked torso. Baptiste drew in a sharp intake of breath, “Son of a bitch!”

The girl's gaunt eyes looked defiantly up at Baptiste. She made no move to cover herself.

Her torso was covered in black marks resembling circuitry, spreading like tendrils from her heart to her extremities. They covered her entire left side and faded back into her skin as the tendrils reached out from the heart.

Sanders began his report as Baptist's eyes followed the shapes of the markings. “The labwork says she is exactly twelve years old, as of today.” Baptiste looked at him, unimpressed. He met her stare evenly and continued, “Due to her...irregularities...we analyzed her DNA sequence and found something quite astounding.”

Sanders led the way back out of the hallway into a lab next door. Clearly the most expensive room in the dilapidated hospital, the lights shone brightly the metallic machines that buzzed softly. Sanders and Baptiste stopped in front of a three panel monitor; one monitor was running DNA sequences, the second one was running numbers, and the third was slowly typing out words. Sometimes the third monitor would type three letters, pause, and then continue at a halting pace. (Little by little  want a different phrase) it was possible to tease out the words being written out and then the sentences that followed.
Sanders turned to Baptiste, “A message has been encoded into her DNA.”

He continued, “The girl is not only the messenger but also the message.”
